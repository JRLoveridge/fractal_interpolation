fractal_interpolation
=====================

This implements a technique for curve fitting by fractal interpolation found in a paper by Manousopoulos, Drakopoulos, and Theoharis, found [here](http://graphics.di.uoa.gr/Downloads/papers/journals/p30.pdf). I also used infromation about non-linear fractal interpolating functions found [here](http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/kobes/).
